## deepening web dev skills

Primary focus is on core web technologies i.e. javascript, html, css.

I'm currently (since Apr '21) enrolled in the [junior web developer training](https://becode.org/learn/junior-web-developer/) at BeCode Brussels.

Following a training helps me with my autistic inertia because it provides me with an outside structure where I get to check-in with people at certain times of the day. Which is especially helpful in the morning.

## launching personal website

### writing posts

Part of the reason of having this website is to lean more into creating, expressing and contributing.
To support me in this process I've received a scholarschip from [Building A Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) and am enrolled in the 12th cohort (starting in May '21).

### moving from social media silos to POSSE

[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) = **P**ublish (on your) **O**wn **S**ite, **S**yndicate **E**lsewhere

I plan on posting all or most content on my website first and from there distribute it to other platforms, thereby following the first [indieweb principle](https://indieweb.org/principles) 'Own your data'.

## living back in Belgium

After having spend 2020 in Portugal, I moved back to Belgium in end of 2020. I'm currently living at my parents while I hone my web dev skills so that I can move towards generating incoming from that skillset in some form later this year.
