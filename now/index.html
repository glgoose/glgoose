      <h2 id="deepening-web-dev-skills"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deepening-web-dev-skills">#</a>deepening web dev skills</h2>
<p>Primary focus is on core web technologies i.e. javascript, html, css.</p>
<p>I'm currently (since Apr '21) enrolled in the <a href="https://becode.org/learn/junior-web-developer/">junior web developer training</a> at BeCode Brussels.</p>
<p>Following a training helps me with my autistic inertia because it provides me with an outside structure where I get to check-in with people at certain times of the day. Which is especially helpful in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="writing-posts"><a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-posts">#</a>writing posts</h3>
<p>Part of the reason of having this website is to lean more into creating, expressing and contributing.<br>
To support me in this process I've received a scholarschip from <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building A Second Brain</a> and am enrolled in the 12th cohort (starting in May '21).</p>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> = <strong>P</strong>ublish (on your) <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>S</strong>ite, <strong>S</strong>yndicate <strong>E</strong>lsewhere</p>
<p>I plan on posting all or most content on my website first and from there distribute it to other platforms, thereby following the first <a href="https://indieweb.org/principles">indieweb principle</a> 'Own your data'.</p>
<h2 id="living-back-in-belgium"><a class="header-anchor" href="#living-back-in-belgium">#</a>living back in Belgium</h2>
<p>After having spend 2020 in Portugal, I moved back to Belgium in end of 2020. I'm currently living at my parents while I hone my web dev skills so that I can move towards generating incoming from that skillset in some form later this year.</p>
