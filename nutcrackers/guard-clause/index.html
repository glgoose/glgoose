<p>What questions are holding me back from writing something publicly?</p>
<ul>
<li>What if I look at back and cringe at my past self for what I wrote?</li>
<li>What if I'm not 100% sure about something I'm writing i.e. don't feel completely confident about the subject?</li>
<li>What if I know that what I wrote isn't yet at its highest standard and I would already like to get my ideas out there?</li>
</ul>

<p>One common reason <strong>we tell ourselves no</strong> is because we don't think we're ready yet. “I'm not experienced enough.” Or, “I need to learn more.” Or, “I need to figure out a better plan first.”<br>
We do this because <strong>we want to succeed right from the beginning</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="solution-breakdown">Solution breakdown<a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-breakdown">#</a></h2>
<p>I borrowed the term guard clause from programming<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. It's a piece of code written at the top, that performs a check and allows an early exit if the precondition is not met.</p>
<p>I borrowed the idea from Devon Zeugel's epistemic statuses<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="guard-clause-definition">Guard clause definition<a class="header-anchor" href="#guard-clause-definition">#</a></h3>
<p>A guard clause is a small section where the author provides some extra context about the piece or the process of writing it.</p>
<p>For example sharing what made you want to write something or sharing what might hold you back from actually putting it out there. It gives the reader a peak behind the curtain and similar to a guard clause in computer programming, it allows them to exit early.</p>
<h4 id="analogy">Analogy<a class="header-anchor" href="#analogy">#</a></h4>
<p>A guard clause is sort of similar to a short voice-over narration in a movie (e.g. like <a href="https://youtu.be/IPXeiS1tzr4?t=83">Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption</a>), allowing the viewer to get a look at the inner experience of the narrator and get some extra context.</p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples<a class="header-anchor" href="#examples">#</a></h4>
<div class="callout example"><header class="callout__header"><p class="callout__title">example</p></header>
<div class=callout__content><p><em>The purpose of this writeup was to summarize something interesting I learned recently, to make sure I understood it. I figured others might find it interesting, too.</em></p>

</div></div>
<p>Something that can generally hold me back is that I know I'm not good at grammar i.e. I struggle with writing properly. A more general guard clause on my website could then be:</p>
<div class="callout example"><header class="callout__header"><p class="callout__title">example</p></header>
<div class=callout__content><p><em>If you encounter any grammatical, spelling or factual mistakes please feel free to let me know or click on the 'Edit this page' link at the bottom of that page and edit it right away.</em></p>
</div></div>
<p>You could something like the following guard clause for publishing articles when they are not yet completely finished  or when you're not entirely satisfied with the result and already get the idea out there.</p>
<div class="callout example"><header class="callout__header"><p class="callout__title">example</p></header>
<div class=callout__content><p><em>This document is a work-in-progress draft at the moment.</em></p>

<h4 id="where-to-place-a-guard-close">Where to place a guard close?<a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-place-a-guard-close">#</a></h4>
<p>The guard clause could be specific to one article, a series of articles or even an entire website. If it's specific to an article it would make sense to put it at the top of the article so the reader gets the information early.</p>

<p>Specifying the state of a piece of writing in a guard clause makes it feel safe and ok to be wrong and not get it 100% correct or perfect right away. And even more so, to quote Devon Zeugel again, &quot;it offers dignity to recognition that you might be wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>It doesn't make it feel like things are set in stone. I can mention when something is still a work in progress and refactor/update later when my knowledge and/or views get expanded. It allows the reader to look into the process of my thinking i.e. how I got to what I ended up writing.</p>
<p>It ultimately allows me to get started, take risks, contribute something, receive feedback and get to know any gaps in my knowledge, which is effectively how you learn. Exposing those gaps and <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> can feel quite vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="2.-having-to-stake-your-identity">2. Having to stake your identity<a class="header-anchor" href="#2.-having-to-stake-your-identity">#</a></h4>
<p>There can be a strong visceral sense that when I write something, someone might attack it and that that would mean something about me as a person, in other words I am identified with my writing.<br>
A concern that is likely shared by more people in today's digital landscape where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You%27ve_Been_Publicly_Shamed">public shaming</a> is quite prevalent.</p>
<p>Bringing those concerns and doubts into the open means I have to acknowledge them in the first place. This very motion takes away the power they hold because I'm no longer trying to protect or uphold my self image. It allows for expression rather than staying in that self protecting cocoon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They allow people to explore concepts that are a little odd <strong>without having to stake their identity to that idea</strong>. I suspect there are a lot of ideas that people aren't comfortable stating that are actually really useful to contributions to the overall intellectual discussion at hand.</p>
<p>— Devon Zeugel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1:1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="3.-battling-with-yourself">3. Battling with yourself<a class="header-anchor" href="#3.-battling-with-yourself">#</a></h4>
<p>It turns writing into an exploration because it takes away the stress that comes from worrying about the previous two points (perfectionism and ego).<br>
It allows me to explore new ideas, contribute something, gain new knowledge and make new friends and connections.</p>
<p>When I'm engaged in an internal battle I stay self-centered and shut off from the world. Giving myself that option to include a guard clause and the act of writing it, is just enough to burst that self-protective bubble of needing to be perfect or needing to be someone and engage with the world.</p>
<p>It's the transition from an internal battle to an external exploration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They violently try to control their minds, their emotions, and their bodies. They become upset with themselves and beat themselves up for not rising up to the conditioned mind's idea of what it believes enlightenment to be.</p>
